## How to update

After completing a feature, run:
```
/update-docs
```
Claude will add an entry to this file with: what was built, key decisions made, any bugs encountered and fixed.

---

## Unreleased — In Progress

### Added
- Project scaffolded from claude-starter template
- CLAUDE.md populated with full Tap Trading domain context
- docs/ folder initialized with spec-doc, architecture, changelog, project-status
- project-plan.md generated (22 steps, 6 phases, ~8 weeks to Milestone 1)

### Fixed
- `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox` missing dep → replaced with `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers` to avoid Hardhat 3 migration chain
- Stale feed test arithmetic underflow (timestamp warp needed before updating mock)
- Missing `batchSettle` external call via `try this.settleOrder()` for partial failure isolation

---

## [0.1.0] — Contracts (target: Week 2)

_Phase 1 complete — 2026-03-31_

### Added
- TapOrder.sol: createOrder, settleOrder, batchSettle, pause/unpause, nonReentrant guards
- PriceFeedAdapter.sol: Chainlink AggregatorV3 wrapper with 60s stale threshold
- PayoutPool.sol: liquidity management, PAYOUT_ROLE access control
- MockV3Aggregator.sol: for local testing with `updateAnswerAndTimestamp`
- **23 Foundry tests**: all settlement edge cases, fuzz tests, batch settle, pause/unpause
- Deploy scripts: base-sepolia, base mainnet (in scripts/deploy.ts)
- TypeChain bindings generated (62 typings via `yarn typechain:gen`)

### Fixed
- Missing `@nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers` devDependency
- Stale feed test needed `vm.warp` before `updateAnswerAndTimestamp` to avoid arithmetic underflow
- batchSettle uses `try this.settleOrder()` external call pattern for per-order failure isolation

### Decisions
- multiplierBps in basis points (500 = 5x) for integer math on-chain
- settleOrder is permissionless (anyone can call) → trustless settlement, no single point of failure
- batchSettle swallows individual settle failures so one bad order doesn't block the batch
